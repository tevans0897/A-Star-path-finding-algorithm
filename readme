This program was written using the IDE "PyCharm".
Only one additional package is needed for the program to function, "vacuumSetUp.py" imports the sqrt function from math

This is an implementation of the A* pathing finding algorithm using a patrolling vacuum bot. The set up is simple, a 5x5 grid is
created and a number of rooms are labeled as dirty. The bot scans which rooms are dirty and find the path with the smallest
number of acy=tions to clean all the rooms

Actions as defined by the bot are moving up, down, left, or right and cleaning a room. 

After the optimal path is found, the bot prints the path to the user console as well as the total number of actions 

The first, and more optimal heuristic is calculated by (distance to closest dirty room + total movement cost so far).

The second, and far less optimal heuristic is calculated by (distance to farthest dirty room + total movement cost so far).

To switch between Heuristics, in the file "vaccumSetUp.py" find the __inti__ and Suck functions for the "Vacuuum" class
Swap the commented lines in each function that set the value of "self.closestDirtyRoom". Approximately lines 34,35 and 63,64.
On turn in the program is set to use the first heuristic.
